  % In order to fix this, we must compute the maximum size of the starting point of
  % each transect. This is specially valid for colinear transects. In standard AGGRA
  % protocol, the impact is lower, as all transects are parallel and will (almost) fall
  % inside the valid region.
  
  % INFO: For the current implementation, we assume that the starting point for the
  % transects as the rightmost point (EAST), as the predominant current is pointing
  % EAST-WEST. We will be using as pivot the corner C:3

  % is the last one; this segment will contain the RIGHTMOST point.
  % The last segment is K
  
  % The polygon is described CLOCKWISE as A-B-C-D, so the points B and C define the
